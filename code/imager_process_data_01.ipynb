Introduction\n","\n","Data from the N2A2 can be distinguished as three primary components:\n","1. FASTQ (sequence, x_f, y_f, quality score) for each sequencing index\n","2. locs (x_l, y_l) for each cluster on each tile\n","3. cifs (intensities [integer]) for each cluster on each tile and cycle\n","\n","The locs and cifs both correspond to the same clusters on each tile, so the primary goal is to associate the clusters to the appropriate fastq files via the shared x,y locations.\n","\n","*Note: The fastq (x_f,y_f) are different from the locs (x_,y_l) by a rounding scheme, so they have to be converted and matched using the appropriate formula*\n","\n","## 2. Processing Overview\n","\n","The data is processed in this order:\n","1. Data is first separated into three folders (fastq, locs, cifs) in a primary run folder from the initial run folder (<run_path>)\n","2. FASTQ data (seq, x_f, y_f) is extracted from the zipped (.gz) fastq files and broken into tiles under a sub-directory (directory name: <fastq_name>_tile_data) as .csv files (seq,x,y)\n","3. Sequence-intensity data is generated for each fastq and exported as csv files in a new child directory (<run_path>/intensities) for each fastq and channel (A,T,C,G).\n"," * The names of the files are <fastq_name>_<processing_tag>_<channel_tag>.csv\n"," * Data is formatted to have seq,x,y,int_1,int_2,...,int_n for the n cycles\n"," * Filtering by sequence can be performed in this step to remove non-compliant sequences under that same sequencing index (if so, the processing tag will be 'filt')\n","\n","Subsequent processing can be performed to remove faulty tiles or otherwise\n","\n","## 3. Usage Instructions\n","\n","Cells in the notebook should be run sequentially unless specified otherwise. Support functions are included as an 'n2a2_utils.py' file in the same directory, so please check the code resources or contact the author if you need the supporting functions file.\n","\n","Make sure to have Python 3.x installed plus common libraries (numpy, matplotlib)\n","\n","## 4. Google Colaboratory (Optional)\n","\n","If processing data using Google Colaboratory, make a copy of this notebook and support file ('n2a2_utils.py') first and then mount your Google Drive (run the appropriate cells below)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JbW_cj9_DsU0"},"source":["## 5.
