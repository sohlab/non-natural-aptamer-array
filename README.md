## Overview

Cluster sequences and cycle intensities are stored in separate files and can be linked for further use. Three types of files are necessary for sequence-intensity linking. The files are `FASTQ`, `locs`, and `cifs` correseponding to sequence-coordinate data, flowcell coordinate data, and cycle intensity data, respectively. After retrieving such data from the sequencer, the code in this repository can be used to link the data.

## Requirements and Usage

The code is compatible with Python 3.x and utilizes common libaries, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), etc.
The instructions and example processing are available in the `code` directory in the `imager_process_data_01.ipynb`


## Project Hardware

A modified Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencer was used for experiments and the necessary files were automatically generated by the Illumina processing workflow. Detailed instructions for experiments and hardware modification can be found in the corresponding manuscript.


## Provided Example

Experimental data is provided for one of the insulin library experiments for the manuscript.
Data for five pools and nine cycles are included.
