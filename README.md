## Overview

To utilize sequence-intensity data from the modified sequencer, cluster seqeunces from canonical sequencing and cycle intensities from the custom measurements need to be linked. Three types of files are necessary for sequence-intensity linking. The files are `FASTQ`, `locs`, and `cifs` correseponding to sequence-coordinate data, flowcell coordinate data, and cycle intensity data, respectively. After retrieving such data from the sequencer, the code in this repository can be used to link the data.

## Requirements and Usage

### Software Requirements

The code requires Python 3.6 and utilizes common libraries.

Other packages used are commonly included and rarely require installation:
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (version 1.21.5)
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (version 3.2.2)

The code has been used and tested with the above versions.

### Hardware Requirements

No special hardware is necessary to run the code in this repository.

## Installation Guide

Beyond Python 3.6, no special requirements are necessary.
No additional installation time is thus required.

For ease of use, the code can be run using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
Installation of Python and package manager can also be accomplished using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

## Demo and Instructions for Use

Experimental data is provided for one of the insulin library experiments for the manuscript.
Data for five pools and nine cycles are included.

Detailed instructions and processing of example data are available in the `code` directory in the `imager_process_data_01.ipynb`

Output for the processing are `csv` files for each library.
Sample output is included in the `int_files` directory.

Processing for an average run takes ~30 minutes.

## Project Hardware

A modified Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencer was used for experiments and the necessary files were automatically generated by the Illumina processing workflow. Detailed instructions for experiments and hardware modification can be found in the corresponding manuscript.
